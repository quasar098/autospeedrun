## practice seed list

- `-1807904186447035469` easy trees, easy bt

## notes

1. mouse calibration
2. pie ray for general bt direction
3. travel to best chunk and go 9,9
4. mine down until chest or until 3 blocks broken (re scan if not there)
5. open chest, loot all essentials
6. travel back to spawn location
7. wander island and scan for leaves/logs
8. break logs
9. crafting table underneath feet, do crafting
10. magma vision detection? O counter? kelp strat? find ravine
11. go down to side of ravine get gravel
12. floor scan l shape magma
13. make l shape portal or something
14. in nether e ray scan for bastion
15. die in lava or something idfk

## potential strategies

- subpixelless one eye using mouse sens and pixel stepping and LLL
- f3 left shift vs crouch left shift discrepancy for faster pie charting
- per biome block assumption heuristics to save mouse scan power
- double bucket fast 2x1 portal on BTs/shipwrecks with lots of iron

## broad todo list

- change most classes to singleton and private defaults instead of having
public static everywhere
- shake mouse with nav enabled and it doesn't go the right way but it should
- all other seed types than BT
